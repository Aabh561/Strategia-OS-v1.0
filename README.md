# 🧠 Strategia OS – Local AI Operating System for Enterprises

> ⚙️ An offline-ready, modular AI system that simulates executive-level strategy, analyzes support operations, and answers complex policy questions — all using private, explainable LLM agents.

## 🏢 Why Strategia OS?

Traditional dashboards show charts.  
**Strategia OS tells you what to do next.**

This project simulates what companies like Siemens, Google, or Microsoft might use *internally* to:

- 🔍 Diagnose customer service inefficiencies from CSVs
- 🤖 Simulate conservative vs aggressive business strategies
- 📚 Query internal policy documents locally using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- 🔒 All using **no APIs, no cloud — only local LLMs via Ollama**
